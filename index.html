          Hi! I'm MaiAda Carpano. I love building websites and teaching future web developers how to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started writing code over 20 years ago when I taught myself HTML and CSS  so I could build myself some sick Neopets and Myspace layouts. I freelanced through grad school and in between jobs, building basic static websites for clients ranging from LECASE Ecovillage, to Marketing inSites to Sharp Shirter.
        </p>
        <p>
          I never considered it possible for me to turn my nerdy hobby into a full time job. I got a Graduate Certificate in Teaching and taught middle school for 6 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I eventually transitioned to a career in web development but I still apply the skills I gained as a teacher every day. Having worked with students with a wide range of abilities has given me a sharp and unique skillset around UX and accessibility. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          I also teach free coding classes on Twitch. My goal is to empower other marginalized people to gain the skills and confidence to pursue a career in tech.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel super lucky that I get to do what I love all day every day - and I even get paid for it!
